# US_Customs_Imports
This is a ETL project on a US Customs Imports data sets from my recent job experience with SkillStorm. 
The data included 11 tables from the years 2018-2020. hopwever for simplicity and less work load on my laptop I only used data from 2018 and tables pertaining to cargo and commodity descriptions such as Bill of Header, Container, and Tariff. 

These data sets were cleaned in Visual Studio Code and then loaded to PostgreSQL for aggregated queries. My goal was to show trends on delays, and insights on cargo/commodities
