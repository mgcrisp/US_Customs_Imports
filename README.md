# US_Customs_Imports
This is a ETL project on Manifest data by the US Customs Imports from my recent job experience with SkillStorm. 
The data included 11 tables from the years 2018-2020. However, for simplicity and less work load on my laptop I only used data from 2018 and tables pertaining to cargo and commodities such as Bill of Header, Container, and Tariff. I was able to find information pertaining to each field at Customs Border Protection's [Automated Manifest Download](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2020-Feb/ACE%20Automated%20Manifest%20Download%20October%202011_0.pdf)

These data sets were cleaned in Visual Studio Code and then loaded to PostgreSQL for aggregated queries. My goal was to show trends on delays, and insights on cargo/commodities 

Of course I have a lot to learn and still making changes to make it look nicer and cleaner :)
